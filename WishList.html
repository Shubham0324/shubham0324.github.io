        <h1>There is No “Perfect Language to Learn”</h1>
        <p>Whenever I do large talks, there will always be one person who asks me
            “which programming language should I start learning first”? There is this
            common perception that somewhere out there lies a perfect language for
            beginner programmers. Some argue it’s Python, some say it’s Swift.
            But I say they’re all wrong.</p>
        <p>A programming language is simply a tool. It is no different from any other
            tool in your hardware box. If you want to hammer a nail, you should be
            using a hammer. If you want to fix your water pipes, you’ll probably need a
            spanner. Yes, it’s possible to hammer in a nail using the side of the spanner
            and the same programming language can be used to solve different types of
            problems. The carpenter will tell you that his favourite tool is a hammer and
            the plumber will say it’s the spanner, but it still doesn’t make it the “best
            tool to fix things”.</p>
        <p>A web developer will tell you that JavaScript is the best language to learn for
            a beginner. A statistician will advise you that you’ll be best served with the R
            programming language. But at the end of the day, all that matters is what
            you are trying to do with your tool. If you want to make iOS apps, then learn
            Swift. If you want to make websites, you’ll need JavaScript. But the good
            news is the core programming concepts: loops, conditionals, functions, etc.
            they’re all the same. The difference is mostly syntactical. In English, we
            have werewolves, in German they have Werwölfe. It’s still the same shirt-ripping mammal that comes out during a full moon, it’s just spelt
            differently.</p>
            <p>Printing to the console in Swift:<br>
                print(“Hello Werewolves”)<br>
            Printing to the console in Java:<br>
                println(“Hello Werwölfe”)<br></p>
        <p>So, decide on the task that you are trying to accomplish, then pick the best
            tool for that task.</p>

        When I first started learning how to code, there were countless times when I
        picked it up then gave up, again and again. This is a common story amongst
        self-taught coders. Looking back, after teaching so many students, I finally
        realise what’s going on. A lot of beginners start learning to code by picking
        an arbitrary language and follow along with a bunch of tutorials. Copying
        code, line by line, sometimes writing code to work out prime numbers, other
        times to find all the even numbers. But you know what? I can find prime
        numbers a lot faster by Googling for it and picking out even numbers is
        really not all that interesting.
        Here’s the truth. If you are learning to code for the sake of learning to code,
        it’ll be pretty difficult for you to get good at it. Skills that require a lot of
        time to hone, like programming, will eat into your pool of internal
        motivation. Something from within that makes you forget to eat and sleep. I
        can honestly say that coding on my own projects is one of the most
        enjoyable things I do. It combines logical thinking with creativity, and at the
        end, you will have made something. In most cases, something that the
        world has never seen. Something that could make your life easier or more
        enjoyable. Something that could make loads of people's lives easier and
        more enjoyable. It’s like making a crazy-beautiful custom motorbike in your
        garage, without needing the garage or spending a cent on the components.
        This is what motivates most people. The creating part. The making part. So I
        urge you to start learning to code by following a tutorial that makes something,
        anything. Of course, it’s unlikely that at the beginning you’ll be
        able to code up Clash of Clans or League of Legends. But you’ll be able to
        make something interesting. It could be a dice game or a flash-card app. But
        as long at the end of the tutorial, you’ll have made something you can use
        and play with, then you’ll be far more motivated to code to the end.
        During all our courses, we always tell our students to think up of a simple
        app that they want to make. Something that uses the skills that they’ve
        learnt during the course but will also stretch them a little because they have
        to find out how to include some new functionality.
        We had a student who went on to make an app that wakes them up a
        minute earlier every day to ease the transition to an earlier waking time.
        There’s a student who made a custom slideshow app as a mother’s day
        present. Someone else made an app that is a timer for making perfect
        steaks based on its weight and thickness.
        There are no limits on your imagination. It will be difficult when you start
        working on your own app because there are no step-by-step instructions,
        but it will also bring about the biggest improvement in your coding ability.
